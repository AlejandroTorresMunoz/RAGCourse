This repository has been created with the purpose to take annotations of this course : [link](https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/take/rag/multimedia/51320308-course-introduction-gen-ai-360-foundational-model-certification).

The main difference with that course is that the annotations, code and examples developed here are with Ollama models (open-source models).

The course is divided into the following modules : 
-   *Module 1* : Recap of the basic concepts of LangChain, and introduction to LlamaIndex and RAG techniques, using Llama 3.1 models and DeepLake as store database.
